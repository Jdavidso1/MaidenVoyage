# AcademyPittsburghLessons
 
Archive of early through advanced learning projects across multiple languages. While most are in a functional state, they generally lack polish (especially the testing, don't look at it) as they were intended to be short instructional exercises.

INTRODUCTORY CONCEPTS:

Cash Register - C# (simple console program counting denominations of change)

Field Painting - C# and Ruby (simple console program calculating area and cost from user input)

Fizz Buzz - C# (a classic!)

Garden Boxes - C# and Ruby (simple console program calculating variable plots per unit size in a given area)

Seasons - C# (simple console program that determines your season of birth based on birthday meant to teach logic and switch cases)

BEGINNER PROJECTS:

Message Box - Ruby (console program to simulate storing and retrieving messages from multiple user inputs)
Message Box - C# (console program with the same functionality but introduces a primitive encryption and decryption)

Morse Code - C# (console program converting user input to morse code via arrays)
Morse Code - Ruby (console program with the same functionality but learning to implement via hash tables)

Roman Numerals - C# and Ruby (console program converting user input values to roman numerals, Ruby includes testing and learning about instance variables)

String Sorter - Ruby (simple console program that will alphabetically sort user input, bonus: first experience with testing!)

INTERMDIATE PROJECTS:

Battleship - C# (console game with responsive persistent grid)

Braille - Ruby (console program that converts user input text to multi-line braille output via hash tables)

Calculator - Ruby (console program attempt at a more robust calculator that can take complex strings with operators as user input, includes some terrible testing)

MadLibs - Ruby (console program with hard-coded story that can be easily changed as the program will always identify the properly formatted 'MadLib' prompts, includes more testing)
MadLibs - C# (console program that reads in a text file for the story and identifies the 'MadLib' prompts)

ADVANCED PROJECTS:

Note that there is a wider disparity in scope, polish and overall completion at this point. The 'finished' product here is more ambitious, and often could not be fully realized due to the blistering pace of the bootcamp, and these generally served more as introductions to be revisited independently.

BuzzFeed - C#/SQL (In depth look at databases and SQL, this console program allows users to create their own BuzzFeed-esque quizzes including questions, point values, results, and take quizzes created by other users. The project was divided into teams working on the quiz maker and the quiz taker separately. Table structure was agreed upon in advance, but groups were challenged to plan and code their program such that both halves would connect seamlessly and cooperate with each other's data. Groups only needed to complete their half, but I loved this project and spent the night coding both sections. Includes some aspirational notes and implementation from the follwing day's review lecture.)

Movie Page - React (Culmination of to-date web dev lessons plus introducing API and Bootstrap to our repertoire, this app is a live marquee for 'Now Playing!' films pulled from The Movie DataBase API, including movie poster, title, release info, overview, etc. Even has light/dark mode, you're welcome! Admittedly, it's a mess given the limited time, but it's one of our more comprehensive and ambitious projects with lots of potential for more features and improvements. Definitely planning to revisit this, stretch goals include incorporating the movie trailer and significant UI refinement/overhaul.)

Stickynotes - HTML/CSS (Okay, so not ADVANCED advanced, but learning some HTML, CSS, events, methods, logic, complexity... The task was just to create a board that the user could add a note to. I love design so I got caught up in trying to add some flourishes here, had to move on with the lessons but still want to spruce this up some day.)

Technicolor Boxes - React (Based on Jennifer Dewalt's 180 project, found here on Day 7: https://jenniferdewalt.com/ Ours is barely React if I'm being honest, basically just ran 'npx create-react-app' and put in a few lines of HTML/CSS and JS, but it's an evolution of our previous ColorBox exercises and a good introduction to frameworks using familiar elements, plus demonstrates some decent visual components and interactivity.)

MISCELLANEOUS:

A Collection of lecture notes, programming scribbles and doodles, and glimpses of activity between larger assignments. Includes some concepts not necessarily represented in other projects because I was almost certainly still wrapping my head around them.

Databases - C#/SQL (Some shorter database exercises leading up to the Buzzfeed project. All console programs focused on taking user input, exposure to varying complexity of table joins, keys, etc.)

OOP - C# and Ruby (Mostly lecture notes and cocktail-napkin code diving deeper into programming fundamentals and some OOP concepts, applying concepts first learned in C# to Ruby, etc.)

Roguelite - Ruby (Less a finished product... I mean, fine, not even close... and more of a scratchpad and from an exercise. We were tasked with creating a game that could move the player around a board with terrain, obstacles, treasure, whatever. We had a day or so to take a crack at it, then an afternoon of lecture on some more sensible approaches, introducing us to functions, classes, inheritance, global and instance variables, etc.)

Web - HTML/CSS and some very basic JS (Mostly lecture notes and short exercises to introduce simple web concepts.)
